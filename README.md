Welcome to my Python Challenge! 

I wanted to showcase my ability to deal with larger datasets without Excel and to further my development in programming. I had been given the inital datasets for PyBank and PyPoll, which are datasets on profit/losses and voting elections, respectively. The premises of this challenge is to come up with a script that is able to analyze the given data and produce a display of the results in the terminal and a text file. Additionally, this was great practice for me to get more comfortable using GitHub by committing often from my VS Code program and to demonstrate my thought process through my code and comments. 

I will first explain the PyBank script. The topics that I wanted answered during my analysis was: 
    1. total number of months included in the dataset
    2. net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period
    3. the changes in profit/losses over the entire period and the average of those changes
    4. the greatest increase in profits with the date and amount
    5. the greatest decrease in profits with data and amount
